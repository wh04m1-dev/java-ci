 1. Java Features
     Java is a powerful, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.
     Key features include:
         Simple: Easy to learn and use.
         Object-Oriented: Everything is an object.
         Platform-Independent: "Write once, run anywhere" using JVM.
         Secure: Provides runtime checking and bytecode verification.
         Robust: Strong memory management and exception handling.
         Multithreaded: Supports concurrent programming.
         Portable: Java programs can be run on any system with JVM.
         High Performance: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers improve performance.
         Distributed: Java supports networking and distributed computing.
 2. Understanding JDK, JRE, JVM
     JDK (Java Development Kit)
         Contains tools to develop, compile, and debug Java programs. Includes JRE and
         development tools like javac, java, etc.
     JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
         Used to run Java applications. Includes JVM and libraries but not development tools.
     JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
         The engine that runs Java bytecode. It abstracts the underlying OS,
         enabling platform independence.
 Flow: Java Source Code (.java) → Compiled to Bytecode (.class) → Executed by JVM
 3. Understanding J2SE, J2EE, J2ME
     J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition)
         Core Java used for desktop applications. Includes core libraries like java.lang,
         java.io, java.util, etc.
     J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition)
         For enterprise and web applications. Includes Servlets, JSP, EJB,
         Web Services, etc. Now called Jakarta EE.
     J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition)
         For mobile and embedded systems. Now largely
         replaced by Android and other tech.
 4. How to Install IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)
     Go to: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
     Download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (Free).
     Install the software.
     Configure the JDK if prompted (download from https://jdk.java.net).
